                    CASMM is developed by the University of Florida and Texas A&M University with support from the
                    National Science Foundation.

                    CASMM, or Computation and Science Modeling through Making, is a cloud-based programming interface
                    designed for fifth and sixth grade students to support them in building computational physical
                    models for science experiments in the classroom.

                    How it Works
                </h1>
                <p>
                    CASMM makes use of Google's <a href='https://developers.google.com/blockly' style={{ color: '#3d5c82', fontWeight: '600' }}>Blockly</a> JavaScript
                    library to build a block based visual programming editor within our user interface. Programs created
                    through the visual programming editor can be compiled into Arduino executable code and uploaded
                    directly onto a students Arduino. These programs, once uploaded to the student's Arduino, provide
                    support in performing a corresponding science project in the classroom.
